## About our Workshops

CDIL workshops engage faculty, staff, and students on campus with a variety of tools and techniques for working with data and technology in their research projects.

Most workshops are held in the CDIL (Room 211) or the instruction room on the second floor of the library.

If you'd like to request or lead a workshop, please email the Workshop Coordinator, Evan Williamson at ewilliamson@uidaho.edu
